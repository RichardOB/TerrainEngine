	 * Here, we set three outer tesselation levels, and one inner level. 
	 * - The outer levels control the subdivision of the triangle's edges:
	 *	A value of 1.0f says "leave it alone", a value of 2.0f means "divide this edge in two" 
	 * - The inner level controlss the subdivision of the triangle's inside. 
	 *	The value here basically says how many internal vertices to generate:
	 *	- Once we get to three internal vertices we get a tiny triangle in the center of our original triangle.
